# COMP55-Resurrection
COMP55 Resurrection
Overview:
I will be implementing the scoreboard class in my Space Invaders game. So after the player wins or loses their score will be saved and when you check the scoreboard screen you should see your name.
I'll have to ask for the user's name and figure out a way to save the score so when you close the game and reopen it, it'll still have that person's score.
Pseudocode:
Create new game pane
Ask user for their name
  Save it into a text file
    Send information to the scoreboard class
  Switch to the game pane

After user wins/loses, save score into a text file
Switch to scoreboard pane
  Add the score to their name
  Save the score on the board
